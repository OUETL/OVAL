# OVAL (Oklahoma Virtual Academic Labratory)
The Oklahoma Virtual Academic Laboratory (OVAL) is a VR-Classroom application designed to encourage remote collaboration between acdaemics. Up to twenty users can inhabit the same VR space, import 3D content, and analyze 3those models with built-in tools.

## Controls
When controling OVAL, you will use the laser coming off of your controler as a cursor. You will "click" on menu buttons by pointing your controlers laser at the button and clicking with the "trigger" listed in the diagrams below. OVAL is designed to be used with one controller, so the controls are mirrored on the right and left.
